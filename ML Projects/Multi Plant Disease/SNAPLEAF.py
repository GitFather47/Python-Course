        Welcome to SnapLeaf: Plant Disease Diagnosis System! üîç
        
        Our objective is to efficiently diagnose plant diseases. Upload an image of a plant, and our system will analyze it to identify any signs of diseases. Let's protect our crops and ensure a healthier harvest together!

        ### How It Works
        1. **Upload Image:** Navigate to the **Disease Diagnosis** section and upload an image of a plant suspected of having diseases.
        2. **Analysis:** Our system will employ advanced algorithms and cnn machine learning model to process the image and diagnose potential diseases.
        3. **Results:** Check out the diagnosis and recommendations for further steps, including medication prescriptions based on the identified disease.

        ### Why Choose Us?
        - **Accuracy:** We utilize cutting-edge machine learning techniques for precise disease diagnosis.
        - **User-Friendly:** Our interface is straightforward and intuitive, ensuring a seamless user experience.
        - **Speed and Efficiency:** Get results within seconds, enabling quick decision-making.

        ### Getting Started
        Click on the **Disease Diagnosis** section in the sidebar to upload an image and experience the effectiveness of our Plant Disease Diagnosis System!

        ### About Us

               ### Dataset Overview
               This dataset has been generated through offline augmentation techniques
               based on an original dataset available in Kaggle(https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/vipoooool/new-plant-diseases-dataset)
               .It comprises approximately 87,000 RGB images depicting both healthy and diseased crop leaves,
               organized into 38 distinct categories. The dataset is partitioned into training and validation sets
               in an 80/20 ratio while maintaining the directory structure. Additionally, a separate directory containing
               33 test images has been created for prediction purposes.

                #### Composition
                1. Training set: 70,295 images
                2. Test set: 33 images
                3. Validation set: 17,572 images
